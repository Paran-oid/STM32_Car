# Ideas

Infrared or LIDAR sensors for better obstacle detection beyond the ultrasonicâ€™s range.

Wheel encoders for precise speed/distance control.

Gyroscope/Accelerometer (IMU) for tilt, acceleration, and stability monitoring.

Temperature monitoring for motor and battery to prevent overheating.

Battery voltage/current monitoring to implement low-battery shutdown or alerts.

Ambient light sensor to adjust LED brightness or trigger night mode.

Collision detection using bump switches for redundancy.

Control & Navigation

PID control for motors to improve smoothness and precise movement.

Line-following mode using IR sensors.

Obstacle avoidance algorithms (basic reactive or A* path planning for autonomous mode).

Servo-based steering optimization for smoother turns.

Speed profiles (accelerate/decelerate curves) to prevent tipping.

Communication

Bluetooth + Wi-Fi fallback: control car remotely via phone or computer.

Send telemetry data (speed, battery, sensor readings) to an app.

OTA firmware updates via Wi-Fi if you integrate ESP32/STM32 networking.

RC failsafe: stop car if connection is lost.

Safety & Alerts

Emergency stop button (physical or wireless).

LED indicators: show battery level, movement direction, or danger proximity.

Audible alarm patterns: different tones for different levels of danger.

Obstacle memory: keep track of dangerous zones to avoid repeatedly.

Power Management

Sleep mode for MCU and peripherals when idle.

Dynamic PWM scaling based on load to save energy.

Solar charging (optional, if outdoors).

Data & Logging

Log sensor data and movements for analysis and improvements.

Path replay mode: car retraces a path it learned.

Machine learning integration for pattern recognition (advanced).

Mechanics & Extras

Camera + OpenCV for vision-based obstacle detection or tracking.

Autonomous parking feature using sensors and servo motors.

Adjustable suspension for rough terrain (if ambitious!).

Modular attachments: e.g., robotic arm, claw, or gripper.
